# Sacred Tree

The town MVP's design and decisions are in
[`kestrel/SACRED_TREE_HANDOFF.md`](../SACRED_TREE_HANDOFF.md). Tasks follow
its milestones, in order; one PR per milestone.

## M1.1 Building kinds, the scene and its supply

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** the map, its items and every tunable come from content (D1,
  "Scene").
- **What to do:** add building kinds (product, period, cap, possessed cap,
  multiplier, Burst, ordered parts) and prebuilt buildings to the supply
  format; the `Sprite` brain; the elder and sprite characters; the scene
  and supply files with the tree depot, four sprites and one Wood Gatherer.
- **Where:** `kestrel/content/src/scenario.rs`, `content/src/character.rs`,
  `kestrel/app/assets/levels/`, `docs/character-definition.md`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M1.2 The buildings table and production

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** buildings are made at runtime and only produce when occupied
  (D1, A1).
- **What to do:** `Settlement::buildings`, production in the economy step,
  output inventories in `balances` and `validate`, the behaviour digest,
  the save format.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/` (new `buildings.rs`),
  `economy.rs`, `mod.rs`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M1.3 Sprites, jobs and slot claims

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** sprites staff buildings on their own and replan when a step
  breaks (D2, A2).
- **What to do:** `Role::Sprite`, the plan builder and replan, `Claim` in
  stage 3 granted in stage 5, `SetSpriteJob` and its control verb.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/agent.rs`, new `sprites.rs`,
  `world.rs`, `kestrel/app/src/control/`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M1.4 Drawing buildings, sprites and outputs

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** occupancy, job and working, waiting or full must read from the
  game view (A7).
- **What to do:** building skins with idle, working and full states,
  sprites with their job and state, output piles, the tree's counts.
- **Where:** `kestrel/view/`, `kestrel/app/`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M2.1 Bundles at piles and the tree

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** resources move only by hand (D6, A4).
- **What to do:** a one-type cargo of 5 for the elder, top-up pickups,
  deposit and withdraw at the tree's wood and stone piles.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/avatar.rs`, `inventory.rs`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M2.2 Interact target and highlight

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** one key covers piles, the tree, sites, slots and sprites (D5).
- **What to do:** `interact_target` in the sim, `Interact { agent, target }`,
  the app's highlight from the same function, the radial menu on sprites.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/action.rs`, `kestrel/app/`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M2.3 Blueprints, sites and installing parts

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** both kinds are built from two installed parts (D4, A5).
- **What to do:** `PlaceBlueprint` and its checks, the ghost and the
  two-option build menu, deliver and install, the needs readout.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/buildings.rs`, `kestrel/app/`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M2.4 Dropping bundles on ground piles

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** the elder must drop a bundle before possessing (requirements
  3.1); piles reuse the pile lab.
- **What to do:** let piles hold any item, not only minerals (handoff,
  "Open questions"), then drop into and pick up from ground piles of wood
  and stone.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/piles.rs`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M3.1 Building seats and ejection

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** the elder becomes a building, and the sprite it displaces
  replans (D3, A3).
- **What to do:** `driving` becomes `seat`, `Board` takes building slots,
  ejection beside the building, the raised cap and the multiplier.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/vehicle.rs`, `avatar.rs`,
  `buildings.rs`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M3.2 Burst

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** the stand-in for building-specific elder abilities (D3).
- **What to do:** `Burst { agent }`, its cooldown on the elder, its control
  verb and its ready indicator.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/avatar.rs`, `buildings.rs`,
  `kestrel/app/`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## M4.1 Happy path and stability

- **Status:** open
- **Why:** the 10-step happy path must play from a fresh start, and
  repeated cycles must never strand a sprite (A6, A8).
- **What to do:** the happy path as a headless control script, the
  stability soak and the bootstrapping test (handoff, "Tests"); fix what
  they find, then tune rates.
- **Where:** `kestrel/sim/src/settlement/` tests, `kestrel/headless/`.
- **Found in:** Sacred Tree handoff.

## Done
